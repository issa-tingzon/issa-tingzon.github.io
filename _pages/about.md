I'm Issa, and I'm a Disaster and Climate Risk Data Fellow at the <a href='https://www.gfdrr.org/en'>World Bank/GFDRR</a>. I also volunteer at <a href='https://www.womenwhocode.com/manila/about'>Women Who Code</a> and <a href='https://www.climatechange.ai/'>Climate Change AI</a>. 

My work focuses mainly on the applications of machine learning/computer vision and earth observation for socioeconomic development, environmental sustainability, and humanitarian response.
